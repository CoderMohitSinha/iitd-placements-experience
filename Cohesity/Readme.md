### Coding Round

- Platform: HackerEarth
- Duration: 1 hour
- Number of Questions: 2

Screenshots of Questions are present in the [coding-exam.pdf](coding-exam.pdf)

### How I approached the exam.

- Read the **Scientifc Farmer** problem first, Realized its an easy dp problem (with a little trick). Did it in 15 minutes. - 50 marks
- The Next "Easy Question" **K freqency** (20 marks) took 45 minutes -_-

### What went worng.

- **The Hackerearth Platform** !!
    + `Ctrl+C` and `Ctrl+V` were disabled.
        * It makes sense to disable external copy paste
        * But you can't even copy paste your own code inside the editor
    + Web page went full screen to detect app switching.
        * Each time you press `Esc` key to ignore intellisense's autocompletiono, App switch detection triggers. And warns you. Its fucking irritating and breaks the concentration and work flow.

- Choosing C++ to do the easy questions.
    + Needed to sort a list of pairs. Based on both pair.first and pair.second
    + Didn't know how to do that in python. Therefore choose C++.

- C++'s syntax , annoying Hackerearth Platfrom => Couldn't debug the code even after ~40 minutes.

### What went right.

- Decided to the dp question first. May not have been able to do it, If attempted it later.
- After 40 minutes of debugging gave up on C++, and wrote the **K Frequency** code in python in 5 minutes (it worked).

### Takeaway

- Use python wherever possible. :)
