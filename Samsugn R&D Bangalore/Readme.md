### Coding Round

#### Question

Given a undirected graph, if the graph can be coloured in two colors then print the vertices which belong to the same color ( you can print vertices with color 0/1), otherwise print -1.

[Similar Problem](https://www.spoj.com/problems/BUGLIFE/)

- Input: First line gives number of vertices(V) and edges(E) (  eg. 7 10)
       Next line contains E pairs representing edges.
- Time: 3 hours
- Only 5 submissions allowed. 
- Must satisfy all 10 test cases to pass.
- No Libaries allowed. Implement everything that you need.

Allowed Libraries

|Language | Memory Input| Output|
|---------|-------------|-------|
|C |malloc, free| scanf, printf|
|C++| new, delete, malloc, free|cin, cout, scanf, printf|
|Java| New (memory freeing is automatic by garbage collector) |java.util.Scanner, System.out.print, printl|

#### Platform

- A very frustrating software which needs to be installed before the exam.
    + Compatible only on windows.
+ The software essentially takes over the entire system.
+ Scrolling is pretty bad:
    * Mouse Scrolling -> Page Up and Page Down
+ They only let you use visual studio and eclipse as editor which should be preinstalled on the system
+ Theire s/w asks for the path to the software. Fair Enough
    * But doesn't save the path. The path remains empty no matter how many times you add the path.
+ Had to resort to the editor provided within the software.
+ You can't even copy-paste the test case from the question to the input box.
 
#### Overall Experience

+ Wasted almost an entire day installing their software and visual studio.
+ Couldn't even use the VS at the end of the day. 
+ Apart from the stupid Platform everything was OK.
+ Question was easy enough to be done within 3 hours (even without any libraries).
